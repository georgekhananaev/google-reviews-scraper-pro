# Changelog

All notable changes to Google Reviews Scraper Pro.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Google Maps "Limited View" bypass** - Google started restricting reviews for non-logged users, showing "You're seeing a limited view of Google Maps". The scraper now bypasses this via search-based navigation (`/maps/search/`) instead of direct place URLs.
- `navigate_to_place()` method with multi-step bypass strategy: session warm-up on google.com, place name extraction, search-based navigation, and direct URL fallback.
- `_extract_place_name()` helper to parse place names from URLs or page titles (supports shortened URLs like `maps.app.goo.gl`).
- `_extract_place_coords()` helper to extract lat/lng from Google Maps URLs for precise search targeting.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-07

### Changed
- Migrated from `undetected-chromedriver` to **SeleniumBase UC Mode** for automatic Chrome/ChromeDriver version management.
- No more manual version matching headaches - SeleniumBase handles it automatically.
